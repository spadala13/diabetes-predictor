# Diabetes Predictor

This Jupyter Notebook predicts diabetes using machine learning algorithm. 

## Objective
The objective of this project was to find what factors influence patients in being diagnosed with diabetes, and what the different correlations are.

## Techniques Utilized
* Data Cleaning
* Data Visualization
* Testing and Training through Machine Learning Model

#### Algorithm used in this project was Random Forest Classifier because it provides highest accuracy through cross validation when many variables play part. It also combines all decision trees into a single model. 

#### Model Evaluation method used is a confusion matrix.
